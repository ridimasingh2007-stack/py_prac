 This repository contains my beginner-level Python projects and exercises.
 I am learning Python and practicing by making small & fun projects.

 * Random Password generator - A password generator that creates strong passwords using characters, digits, and punctuation symbols.
 * A scientific calculator - A Python-based **Scientific Calculator** with support for basic arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and power functions.


About:-
This repo is mainly for:
* Practicing Python syntax and problem-solving.
* Learning how to work with GitHub repositories.
* Tracking my progress as I grow in coding.
