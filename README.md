# Python Practice Repository

 This repository contains my beginner-level Python projects and exercises.
 I am learning Python and practicing by making small & fun projects while exploring core concepts.

 Projects:-
 * Number Guessing Game - A game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user has to guess it.
 * Random Password Generator - A password generator that creates strong passwords using characters, digits, and punctuation symbols.
 * A Scientific Calculator - A Python-based **Scientific Calculator** with support for basic arithmetic, trigonometric, logarithmic, and power functions.
 * Random Jokes Generator - A mini project based on API and JSON to fetch and display random jokes with the help of loops in python.


About:-
This repo is mainly for:
* Practicing Python syntax and problem-solving.
* Learning how to work with GitHub repositories.
* Tracking my progress as I grow in coding.

#More projects coming soon!!
